# Task-01: Git Exercises

Welcome to my Git journey!  
This document outlines my experience with **Task-01: Git Exercises** from the **amFOSS curriculum**. It explains my understanding of each problem, the approach I used to solve it, and the Git commands I applied.  

I initially didn’t know how to start this task, but I was very excited to explore Git beyond the basic commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`. This task provided a wonderful opportunity to understand Git in depth, and I really enjoyed it.

## Resources I Used
- [Git Official Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)

## Exercise 1: [master]

**Command used:**  
```bash
git start master
```
This is a custom Git command provided by the Git Exercises site. It initializes a new exercise environment by setting up the master branch and preparing the repository for the given task.
